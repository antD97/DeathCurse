<!-- bringing someone back to life "comes with a price"/"has a cost"/"takes a lot of energy/takes a lot of work" -->
<!-- you will find "yourself"/"life to be"/"things"/"the world" -->
Gone are the days of resurrecting without consequence. Don't you know bringing someone back to life
comes with a price? It's about time you learn. For every subsequent life you live, you will find
life to be increasingly *unstable*. Enjoy.
<!-- or *increasingly* unstable/*increasingly unstable* -->

Death Curse is a Minecraft datapack that applies a curse to players that respawn. For every respawn,
the curse worsens. Some of the features require particles to be enabled so be sure to turn them on!

Curse difficulty balance is currently a work in progress and everything is subject to change.
